# Milestone Project 2: Travel Blog 

The inspiration of this project comes from our group membersâ€™ interests in traveling and sharing our personal experiences. Our Travel Blog project displays group collaboration and our growth in both front and back-end development. 

The use of this application is fully customizable! It allows those who have traveled to share their stories, recommendations, photos and overall experiences. 


## Technologies Used For Application

Database used for our travel blog is MONGODB.

Material UI open-source react component library was used to aid travel blog's design.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
